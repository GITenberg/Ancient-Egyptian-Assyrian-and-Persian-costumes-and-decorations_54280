<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">If</span> this work is to be kept within its limitations, it is naturally
impossible to give a complete survey of all the varieties of the various
styles. To get this knowledge it will be necessary to consult the works
of reference, of which lists are given in each section. On the other
hand, the special aspect of the work is more fully treated than in any
other accessible book upon the subject.</p>

<p>Every illustration of costume given has been actually cut out and made
up before being sketched, except in a few cases which are of the nature
of duplicates, so that by following the directions given it will be easy
for anyone to reproduce them in material. Where decoration is required,
the exact drawing and colouring of the various styles of Historic
Ornament, which are the work of F. S. Hornblower (who has also coloured
the costumes where necessary), will enable such details to be
appropriately applied.</p>

<p>Throughout the book, the illustrations are given by means of facsimiles
of drawings by artists of the various centuries, so that a historic
survey of the History of Figure Drawing will be included. Where the
drawings of primitive artists do not clearly express the ideas intended
to be conveyed, a modern drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi"></a>{vi}</span> of the garment on a dress-stand will
be used for explanation of the measured drawings of the cut-out
garments. The growing appreciation of the beauty and value of the
earlier and more primitive systems of cutting shown in modern dress
designing for the last decade, when the so-called Magyar blouse (really
the simple tunic common to all primitive folk) began to be popular, will
make the present volume a convenient form of inspiration for designers;
also, where more exact reproduction is needed, as in theatrical work,
pageantry, and so forth, the careful working out of the details of cut
and decoration will expedite production and save hours of fruitless
searching in reference libraries.</p>

<p>To the Art Student, in addition to the always interesting history of
costume, the development of the Art of Representation, as shown in the
illustrations of these volumes, which is so strangely repeated in the
personal history of every young person learning to draw, will be
attractive and instructive. Finally, in connection with the history
lesson in the ordinary school, teachers will find the illustrations
clear and helpful, especially if dramatic representations are attempted.</p>

<p class="cb">GENERAL DESCRIPTION<br />
OF<br />
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN COSTUME</p>

<h3>CUTTING OUT</h3>

<p>As far as the cutting out of ancient Egyptian costume is concerned, we
may divide it broadly into four types&mdash;namely: (1) The type of the
<i>tunic</i>. (2) The type of the <i>robe</i>. (3) The type of the <i>skirt</i>, with
or without cape. (4) The type of the <i>shawl</i> or <i>drapery</i>. The one or
two varieties which occur in addition to these may be found in military
dress and adaptations from the costumes of other countries. All the
varieties above referred to are described in detail in this volume.</p>

<h3>DECORATION AND COLOURING</h3>

<p>Though we find Egyptian costume in many instances decorated all over
with woven or printed patterns, decoration in the main was confined to
accessories such as the head-dress, collar, and girdle, these being
often painted, embroidered, beaded, or jewelled. See various examples
given. The colouring which was usually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>{4}</span> though not invariably, confined
to the decorations consisted of simple schemes, variations of the hues
of red, blue, green, yellow, and deep purple described on <a href="#page_66">p. 66</a>.</p>

<h3>MATERIAL</h3>

<p>The material used in the costumes was chiefly linen. In the most ancient
types it was of a fairly thick, coarse weave; but in the later examples
a fine thin linen, loosely woven so as to appear almost transparent, was
used. The linen has often a stiffened appearance, and also gives the
idea of having been goffered or pleated.</p>

<h3>DATES</h3>

<p>The earliest types of costume were the tunics; midway come the robes and
skirts, and the draped or shawl type of costume appears the latest.
However, the older types of costume did not disappear as the new ones
were introduced, but all continued to be worn contemporaneously. The
dates of most of the costumes in this volume are given with their
description, and have been verified at the British Museum.</p>

<h3>MEN AND WOMEN: THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR DRESS</h3>

<p>It can easily be gathered from the illustrations that the types of
costume worn by both sexes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a>{5}</span> very similar. The high waist-line
prevails in feminine dress, while the male costume, if girded, was
generally confined about the hips.</p>

<h2>ANCIENT EGYPTIAN COSTUME</h2>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap"><a href="#plt_I">Plate I.</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#plt_I">Plate I.</a>, which dates 700 <small>B.C.</small>, is an exact copy of an Egyptian drawing.
It will be noticed that the Egyptian method of representing the figure
is a peculiar one. A modern representation of the same type of dress is
shown in <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, and the plan of cutting in <a href="#fig_2A">Fig. 2<small>A</small></a> It should be noted
that this plan&mdash;namely, a tunic with braces&mdash;is in some instances shown
with the braces buttoned on each shoulder at the narrowest part. This
illustration is given as a type of Egyptian dress decoration, which
would be either printed, painted, or embroidered on the garment. It
might be considered that this type of dress more nearly approaches the
skirt than the tunic; but reaching, as it does, to the breast-line, and
comparing various examples which, as it were, gradually merge into the
sleeveless tunic which again merges into the tunic with short sleeves,
the present classification will be found to be the most convenient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a>{7}</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><a href="#plt_II">Plate II.</a></span></h3>

<p><a href="#plt_II">Plate II.</a>, which dates 1700 <small>B.C.</small> also first century <small>B.C.</small>, is an exact
copy of an Egyptian drawing of a woman wearing a species of tunic with
braces (plan, <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). The striped decoration upon this tunic is
suggested by the lines of another type of Egyptian dress&mdash;namely, the
drawn-up skirt. The origin of the decoration can be easily understood by
a reference to the drapery on <a href="#plt_IX">Plate IX.</a> In the original of this drawing
the figure is represented with a lofty head-dress in addition to the
fillet of ribbon and the golden asp here shown, but for the sake of
getting the figure on a scale large enough to show clear details the
head-dress is omitted. The person represented is said to be Cleopatra
dressed as a goddess.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#fig_2">2</a>, <a href="#fig_3">3</a>, and <a href="#fig_4">4</a>, dating 1700, 1500, and 3700 <small>B.C.</small> respectively, are
wearing dresses of the first great type of Egyptian costume&mdash;namely, the
tunic type. They were made of fairly thick linen. <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a> is put on by
stepping into it and pulling it up. Figs. <a href="#fig_3">3</a> and <a href="#fig_4">4</a> are put on over the
head; the measurements given will fit a slim figure without
underclothing. The origin of <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a> was most probably a piece of linen
of the same length as this garment but wide enough to lap about half
round the figure and have a piece tucked in at the top to keep it
closed. This sort of tight drapery is quite commonly worn by negresses
in Africa to-day. We also find it on some ancient Egyptian wooden
statuettes, the drapery being of linen while the figure only is in
wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a>{11}</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><a href="#plt_III">Plate III.</a></span></h3>

<p>It will be noticed that the Egyptian dress decoration is chiefly
confined to the collar, which will be seen in wear on Plates <a href="#plt_V">V</a>., <a href="#plt_VI">VI</a>.,
<a href="#plt_VIII">VIII</a>., and <a href="#plt_X">X</a>. The patterns were either embroidered, painted, beaded, or
jewelled; the favourite lotus flower is almost always in evidence in the
designs (see a, b, c, and d on <a href="#plt_III">Plate III.</a>). On this plate also will be
seen several other characteristic borders (f, g, h, i), and two all-over
patterns (k, e), which were probably either stamped or tapestry-woven on
the dress fabric. The colouring of these patterns is chiefly taken from
<i>painted</i> representations of persons and ornaments. To arrive at the
exact colouring used if the garments were decorated with dyed materials
the description of the types of colours used in dyeing ancient Assyrian
and Persian costumes, see <a href="#page_66">p. 66</a>, will give a more exact notion of what
was worn. We have, in the British Museum, actual examples of dyed wools
and coloured beads used in dress decoration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a>{13}</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><a href="#plt_IV">Plate IV.</a></span></h3>

<p><a href="#plt_IV">Plate IV.</a> belongs to the next great division of Egyptian costume, which
may be called the “Type of the Robe.” This illustration shows it in its
simplest form&mdash;namely, ungirded. To understand the quaint Egyptian
drawing of <a href="#plt_IV">Plate IV.</a> a reference to <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a> is necessary, which is a
modern drawing of the same costume. As will be seen from the plan, <a href="#fig_5A">Fig.
5<small>A</small></a>, this garment consists of a piece of material twice the height of the
figure and folded over in the middle; a hole is here cut for the neck
and, in addition, a short slit down the front to allow of the garment
being pulled over the head. The material is sewn up the sides from the
bottom, leaving a space at the top for the passage of the arms. A
garment similar in type to this is worn at the present day in Egypt and
Syria, and also, strange to say, by the natives of Brazil.</p>

<p>This robe should be compared with that worn by Darius, King of Persia,
later in this volume.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><a href="#plt_V">Plate V.</a></span></h3>

<p><a href="#plt_V">Plate V.</a>, dating 1450 <small>B.C.</small>, shows the same robe as <a href="#plt_IV">Plate IV.</a> worn in a
different manner. In this case the garment is left open down the sides,
the front half is taken and pinned at the back of the waist, and the
back half is drawn towards the front and girded with a wide sash
measuring 32” × 120”, as shown in <a href="#plt_V">Plate V.</a> and Figs. <a href="#fig_6">6</a>, <a href="#fig_7">7</a>, <a href="#fig_8">8</a>, and <a href="#fig_9">9</a>. It
should be noted that <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a> is a modern drawing of <a href="#plt_V">Plate V.</a>; also the
costume upon p. <a href="#page_19">19</a>, which dates 2500 <small>B.C.</small>, gives three different views
of the same dress, a costume which emphasizes the love of the Egyptians
for drawing up the dress tightly so as to define the limbs at the back
and allowing great masses of drapery to fall in front to the feet. To
adjust the sash or girdle on <a href="#plt_V">Plate V.</a>, commence at the right side of
waist drawing the sash downwards to the left and round the hips at back,
next draw upwards across the front from right to left and round waist at
back and tuck the remaining length of sash in front as shown in <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17"></a>{17}</span></p>

<p>The decoration on this plate shows the detail of the characteristic
Egyptian winged globe (a), hawk (b), and beetle (scarabæus) (c). Plates
<a href="#plt_I">I</a>. and <a href="#plt_VIII">VIII</a>. are examples of the application of winged decoration upon
Egyptian costume.</p>

<p>Three other geometrical borders (d, e, and f) and two all-over patterns
(g and h) are given; g shows an example of the well-known feather or
scale pattern; h (which is similar to e, <a href="#plt_III">Plate III.</a>) is a favourite
geometric motif, and was often printed or painted on garments. A very
charming effect also of this pattern was a tunic entirely composed of
beads, or beads and reeds, and worn over the garment shown on <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, <a href="#page_11">p.

<p>The third outstanding type of Egyptian costume may be described as the
“Type of the Petticoat and Cape” (the petticoat was sometimes worn
without the cape). Now this petticoat or skirt, as shown in <a href="#plt_VIII">Plate VIII.</a>
and <a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>, consists of a straight cut piece of material threaded
through at the waist with a narrow strip which is knotted round the
figure to keep the garment in position; the cape-like shoulder drapery
is an oblong piece of stuff, to drape which take the corners d and e of
<a href="#fig_11A">Fig. 11<small>A</small></a> in your hands and twist them till the triangles a, b, c, and d,
e, f, have become cords, and then knot as shown in the diagram. In the
skirt piece, Fig. 11<small>B</small>, sew together the two short sides. As will be seen
in the illustration, a long knotted girdle about 100 inches in length is
worn over the skirt. It passes twice round the waist, and is knotted at
the back as well as the front. In <a href="#plt_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> the deep ornamental collar
is worn over the cape. The collar, which was fastened down the back, is
shown in plan (<a href="#fig_11C">Fig. 11<small>C</small></a>).</p>

<p><a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a> shows another method of wearing a similarly cut but rather
longer skirt; in this case there is no waist cord; two pieces of the
upper edge about half a yard apart are taken in the hands and twisted,
one is crossed over the other and tucked inside, the other is pulled up
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25"></a>{25}</span></p>

<p><a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a> is an Egyptian woman’s costume dating 1450 <small>B.C.</small>; she is wearing
two garments&mdash;namely, a skirt and cloak. This skirt, which is frequently
worn alone without the cloak, as shown in <a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>, is cut to exactly the
same width top and bottom. It is wide for the figure, and the
superfluous fullness is caught up in each hand in the act of putting on.
The upper edge of garment is drawn tightly round the figure just under
the breasts; the portions held in each hand are then tied together in a
knot. In <a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a> the cloak is knotted in with the skirt; this cloak is
simply a rectangular piece of material. It will be noted that Figs. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>,
<a href="#fig_14">14</a>, and <a href="#fig_15">15</a> all show the popular Egyptian effect of drapery drawn tightly
round the back of the limbs and falling full in front.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a>, which dates <small>A.D.</small> 200, shows a Roman adaptation of the same
costume. The figure wears underneath a long tunic, and over this,
tightening it in at the waist, an Egyptian skirt; a small Egyptian scarf
is knotted to the skirt in similar fashion to the costume in <a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>.
All the garments worn by <a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a> are rectangular pieces of material; the
tunic is two straight pieces of stuff sewn up the sides; the top edge is
divided into three parts by pinning; these openings form the neck and
arm-holes.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a> is a Greek costume of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> in which the
Egyptian influence is equally strongly marked; in this case, again, the
garments are all rectangular<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31"></a>{31}</span> pieces of material, the sleeves in one
with the tunic. To knot the cloak to the over-skirt, as shown in this
figure, the fullness of the over-skirt should be bunched up in one hand;
the two corners of the cloak are taken in the other hand and twisted
together round the skirt in a knot.</p>

costume. They have many resemblances to the draping of the well-known
Indian sari of modern times. Compare these with illustration of sari (<a href="#page_39">p.
39</a>). The ingenuity displayed in the draping of these costumes can only
be realized when they are actually done upon a model. It should be noted
with regard to all Egyptian costumes of the more fully draped type that
the entire draperies seem to radiate from one point, usually a knot at
the waist, with very beautiful effect.</p>

<p class="cb">A COMPARISON<br />
<small>THE INDIAN “SARI”</small></p>

<p>Before passing from Egyptian costume, it seems interesting to compare
the accompanying illustrations of an ordinary present-day draping worn
by women in India. This long shawl drapery (the “sari”) presents
extraordinary similarities to some of the ancient Egyptian shawls or
draperies already illustrated.</p>

<p>The method of draping is as follows: Tie a waist cord; take the corner b
and fix it to the right-hand side of waist, then pass the edge b-a
across the front of waist, round the left side towards the back, and
round the back of waist again to the right side; now take up some pleats
in the drapery and push them inside the waist cord in centre front of
waist, then pass on the drapery round the waist to back and round to the
right side again. Now catch up all the remaining drapery and throw it
upwards across the chest over the left shoulder. Let the corner c hang
down the back, and bring the corner around towards the front of waist
and tuck it in at the left side of waist, so that it will have the
thrown-over portion to the right of it. This completes this draping of
an Indian sari. The width of this sari will drape a figure of 5’ 4”,

<p class="cb">GENERAL DESCRIPTION<br />
OF<br />
ANCIENT ASSYRIAN COSTUME</p>

<h3>CUTTING OUT</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">There</span> are practically only two types of garment generally found in the
representations of ancient Assyrian costume: (1) the <i>shawl</i>, and (2)
the <i>tunic</i>. These vary in size and proportion, and are worn either
alone, but more generally in combination.</p>

<h3>DECORATION</h3>

<p>Except in the earliest examples, decoration is lavish in Assyrian
costume; in fact, the costume of a King when at its richest may be said
to be absolutely covered with ornament. Jewellery, woven and embroidered
patterns, and fringes are used in the utmost profusion. See the
illustrations of the most characteristic ornamental details of this
style.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46"></a>{46}</span></p>

<h3>MATERIAL</h3>

<p>The materials used seem to have been of linen and wool. The skins and
furs of animals and metal were also in use, but chiefly for military and
hunting costume.</p>

<h3>DATES</h3>

<p>The earliest type of costume here shown is a rather elaborate shawl
drapery worn without any tunic underneath. Later comes the tunic with
various fringed shawl draperies worn in addition, and some of the latest
types have the tunic worn alone without the shawl draperies. The dates
given for the costumes illustrated in this style have been verified at
the British Museum. It should be remembered, as in the case of ancient
Egyptian costume, that the dresses changed very slowly indeed, and most
styles of this era were worn literally for hundreds of years.</p>

<h3>MEN AND WOMEN: THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR DRESS</h3>

<p>The representations of costume which Assyrian art has left us are almost
entirely those of men’s dress. Two examples of women’s dresses are shown
in this volume. The first wears a plain ungirded tunic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47"></a>{47}</span> a simply
draped shawl covering the figure partially. The second is the dress of a
Queen, and has the tunic almost entirely covered with a voluminous
shawl. The wide belt with narrow belt over it seems to be confined to
the men’s costume, as also the tighter and scantier shawl draperies
which exist in singular variety.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#fig_26">26</a>, <a href="#fig_27">27</a>, and <a href="#fig_28">28</a>: This drapery is from the figure of the King Gudea,
2500 <small>B.C.</small> (see British Museum). To drape, place the corner b of <a href="#fig_26A">Fig. 26<small>A</small></a>
under left arm-pit, and draw the edge b-a round the back of shoulders
under the right arm-pit, across the front of chest, and round the back
again, and under the right arm-pit once more; then throw the edge b-a
upwards across the chest and over the left shoulder; the corner a will
then hang down the back. Take this corner a and tuck it in at the right
side of breast, as shown in illustration (<a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>). It should be noted
that, unless the left hand is raised, the left arm and hand are entirely
covered by this drapery, the right arm only being left free for
movement. This dignified drapery presents points of similarity to the
Roman “toga” of a much later period.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49"></a>{49}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#plt_XI">Plate XI.</a></span>&mdash;This type of dress, which in the British Museum is described
as worn by “a Mythological Figure in attendance upon King
Assur-nasir-pal”, ninth century <small>B.C.</small>, might be dated about 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, as
following the usual custom of the ancients who dressed their sacred
figures in the costume of some previous generation as a rule, consists
of a simple tunic with short sleeves, and reaching to the knee, cut in
similar fashion to the Egyptian; then a small shawl (<a href="#fig_29B">Fig. 29<small>B</small></a>) is
wrapped round the hips, beginning with the corner a on right hip, and
passing the edge a-b across the front towards the left and round the
waist. The triangle b-e-f can be tucked in at waist-line; then the wide
belt, probably leather, which is coloured buff in the illustration, is
put on and kept in position by the narrow belt, which is coloured red;
this belt is much better seen in <a href="#fig_30">Fig. 30</a>. Lastly, the large shawl (<a href="#fig_29A">Fig.
29<small>A</small></a>) has the corner b tucked in to narrow belt at left side of waist,
and the edge a-b passed round the back towards the right side of waist
upwards across the chest, and hangs down the back over the left
shoulder. The original of this figure is winged, the wings being omitted
here.</p>

about 20 inches square. Note the tassels hanging from right-hand bottom

<a href="#fig_34">34</a>, <a href="#fig_35">35</a>, and <a href="#fig_36">36</a>. The King wears over his long tunic a very beautiful and
dignified shawl drapery, which is fringed, recalling certain Egyptian
types already illustrated, and, indeed, has points of similarity with
certain Greek and Roman draperies. To drape this shawl (see <a href="#fig_34A">Fig. 34<small>A</small></a>)
fold over on the line e-f so that e-f, a-b, hangs down outside; then
attach the cord e-g as illustrated, and hold g at right side of waist in

<p class="nind">sling over the left arm, as shown. To complete the draping, continue to
pass the edge e-f round the waist towards the right, passing under the
right elbow, then on round the back and left side until it reaches about
6 inches in front of left side of waist; now fold the remainder of
drapery underneath, as shown in the drawings, and tie a cord round waist
to keep all firmly in position; knot the end of the cord e-g to this
waist cord. <a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a> shows the back view, and <a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a> shows the drapery
thrown off the left shoulder to give freedom to both arms, Figs. <a href="#fig_34">34</a> and
<a href="#fig_35">35</a> only giving freedom to the right arm. If the cord e-g is pulled down
so that e touches the waist, then both shoulders will be covered by the
drapery. <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a> is the most usual arrangement of this type of drapery,
but in looking at <a href="#plt_XIII">Plate XIII.</a> closely it will be seen that the modern
drawing (<a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>) is a more exact rendering. This drawing is from a
draping of the same shawl as <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a> is wearing, but the fold-over is
somewhat deeper, the point e is tied closely to waist belt, and the
drapery is rolled at waist while it is being adjusted. When worn thus,
with a roll, the drapery will remain in position without the waist cord
being tied over it, but it is more secure when it has been thus
confined. <a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a> is still another variety of this type of draping, and
is taken from a small statue of Assur-nasir-pal in the British Museum;
there we have two shawls, one square and one semicircular (see Figs. <a href="#fig_38A">38<small>A</small></a>
and <a href="#fig_38B">38<small>B</small></a>). To arrange this drapery, take the square shawl and fold
outwards about 20 inches, as at e-f. Tie a waist cord on the tunic, and
tuck the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65"></a>{65}</span></p>

figure in front and round again across the back of waist till the left
side is reached again. Now double about 6 inches of the shawl inwards,
and tuck again into waist cord. Take the semicircular shawl g-h, and
attach the cord to another waist cord, throw backwards over the right
shoulder, and arrange a sling over the left arm as before in Figs. <a href="#fig_34">34</a>
and <a href="#fig_37">37</a>. The corner h of the shawl shows in front about 8 inches below
the waist towards the left. Tie the second waist cord tightly over this
shawl to keep in position.</p>

<p class="c">NOTE ON THE COLOURING OF ANCIENT ASSYRIAN<br /> AND PERSIAN COSTUMES</p>

<p>Though we do not possess the actual specimens of these costumes, still
we can infer from the lavish ornament, and, from references in the
Hebrew Old Testament writings, that rich colouring prevailed. The dyes
were probably similar to those of ancient Egypt, and this table will
suggest the particular hue of each colour:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
style="margin-left:4%;">

<tr><td class="c" colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Ancient Egyptian and Assyrian Dye Colours</span></td></tr>

<tr><td align="left"><i>Blue</i>:</td><td align="left">Usually rather a dark indigo, sometimes paler.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>Red</i>:</td><td align="left">Much like the colour known as Indian red.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>Yellow</i>:</td><td align="left">Similar to yellow ochre.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>Green</i>:</td><td align="left">Much like the paint known as green bice, but rather more dull.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>Purple</i>:</td><td align="left">Dark, and quite a brownish hue of purple.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All these colours could be used as embroideries on a white or natural
coloured ground of linen, the embroideries being of wool. In other cases
the whole garment might be coloured throughout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67"></a>{67}</span></p>

<p class="cb">GENERAL DESCRIPTION<br /> OF<br /> ANCIENT PERSIAN COSTUME<br />
ALSO INCLUDING TWO EXAMPLES FROM CAPTIVE NATIONS</p>

<h3>CUTTING OUT</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> garments illustrated in this style are of four types; of these,
three have already appeared in the two previous styles&mdash;namely, the type
of the <i>tunic</i>, the type of the <i>robe</i>, and the type of the <i>shawl</i> or
drapery. In ancient Persian costume we come for the first time to type
five: the <i>coat</i>. We may refer here also for the first time to the
wearing of trousers, for these are usually shown worn with the coats in
ancient Persian costume, and a diagram is given on p. 86 showing one of
the earliest known methods of cutting these garments.</p>

<h3>DECORATION</h3>

<p>Ancient Persian decoration was so exceedingly similar to ancient
Assyrian that it does not seem necessary to illustrate it. We do not
find, however, that ancient Persian garments were ornamented to anything
like the same extent as ancient Assyrian; the frequent fringes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78"></a>{78}</span> the
ancient Assyrian costumes were not nearly so lavishly employed in the
ancient Persian style.</p>

<h3>MATERIAL</h3>

<p>Linen and wool were most probably the chief materials used in ancient
Persian costume, but there are indications that leather may have been
rather extensively employed in the more tight-fitting garments.</p>

<p>It must not be taken that either in Assyrian or ancient Persian dress
the garments fitted as smoothly and tightly as might be imagined from
the sculptured and painted representations; it is true folds are
sometimes indicated, but the chief concern of the artists of both styles
was to show the human figure and richly decorative ornament.</p>

<h3>DATES</h3>

<p>The illustrations here given of ancient Persian costumes date about the
sixth and fifth centuries <small>B.C.</small> with two of neighbouring nations dating
eighth century <small>B.C.</small> and sixth and fifth centuries <small>B.C.</small> respectively.</p>

<h3>MEN AND WOMEN: THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR DRESS</h3>

<p>There is not sufficient information to form a definite picture of the
women’s dress of this period and style;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79"></a>{79}</span> most probably it was a simple
tunic and shawl like that worn in Assyria, but an interesting fact is
that we have a representation of the Queen of a Persian King who reigned
in the fifth century <small>A.D.</small> who is wearing trousers, which, it will be
remembered, are worn by Persian women of the present day. In this
connection it may be noted that the history of costume, as developed
through the use of woven materials, presents a much more simple aspect
than the history of those styles bearing evidences of having been first
cut from leather. A moment’s reflection will make it clear that in the
case of woven stuffs the most economical system of cutting, and indeed
the most obvious, for the primitive dress fashioner, was based on the
rectangle. On the other hand, the fashioner of leather garments would
naturally try to fit the human body with, as it were, a second skin,
hence trousers and tight-fitting jackets may appear in very early
civilizations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#plt_XVI">Plate XVI.</a></span> is a representation of Darius, King of Persia, sixth and
fifth centuries <small>B.C.</small>; he is wearing the Median “Robe of Honour.” It will
be seen from the plan (<a href="#fig_40A">Fig. 40<small>A</small></a>) that this robe is sewn up each side,
leaving a space of 20 inches on either side for the hands. Like the
Egyptian robe, the material required is twice the height of the figure,
the material is doubled, a neck-hole cut, and the garment is pulled on
over the head. The Persian or Median method of wearing the garment is
unique: a girdle is tightly bound round the waist, and then the robe is
pulled up at either side over the girdle so as to produce the very
elegant effect shown in <a href="#plt_XVI">Plate XVI.</a> and <a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a>, which is a modern
drawing of the front view of <a href="#plt_XVI">Plate XVI.</a>, the result giving great freedom
to the arms. The King seems to have two robes of the same cut, one under
the other.</p>

<a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a> the corner a is thrown backwards over the left shoulder, and the
edge a-b is passed across the chest and under the right arm-pit, then
drawn across the back, and the corner b falls down in front of the left
shoulder.</p>

<p>This costume is not Persian, but that of some nation to the east of
Persia in northern Asia Minor. The wearing of boots with upturned toes
as here shown seems to have extended from Persia across northern Asia
Minor to the Mediterranean even as far west as Italy.</p>

<p>The “Peeps” Series, written primarily for young people, giving glimpses
of the scenery of various countries with the life and manners of the
people, now includes sixty volumes, all of which have proved exceedingly
popular.</p>

<p>This new group deals with the lands of the older civilizations, and the
aim of the writer has been in each case to put before his readers a
series of pictures of the various aspects of life in the great days of
each country. For example, the country, development, and spirit of the
people of <b>Ancient Assyria</b> are shown when that nation was the greatest in
the Ancient World, and it is pointed out that their land was the cradle
of civilization. The splendour of the Court of <b>Ancient Egypt</b>, the
achievements of the Egyptians in exploration, conquest, art,
architecture, and science are indicated, and special stress has been
laid upon the depiction of child life and its surroundings. <b>Ancient
Greece</b> is depicted when the nation was at the summit of its glory and
achievement, while its matchless art and the effect of the universal
prevalence of athletic training in the physical development of the race
are given special prominence. Dealing with <b>Ancient Rome</b> the writer
reconstructs the early Empire and the Imperial City at the time of its
greatest splendour, and we are conducted in spirit to the Chariot Races
at the Circus Maximus and the Gladiatorial Sports at the Colosseum.</p>

<p>The illustrations in the volumes faithfully depict the life and costume
of the period and include examples of the pictorial and sculptured art,
the architecture, and some imaginative scenes from the legends of those
old days.</p>

<p>The writer’s aim in this volume has been to present to the general
reader, in an untechnical and readable form, the results of the various
explorations which have recently done so much to enlarge our knowledge
of the great prehistoric civilization which preceded that of classic
Greece, and on whose ruins Greek culture, as we know it, arose. The
ancient legends pointing to the existence of a great sea-power in
prehistoric Crete are narrated, and a short account is given of the
civilization assumed in the Homeric poems. Thereafter, the work of
Schliemann, leading to the discovery of the Mycenæan culture, is briefly
described, and, turning to Crete itself, an account is given of the
remarkable discoveries at Knossos, Phæstos, and elsewhere, which have
revealed the relics of the wonderful empire of the Minoan sea-kings with
its advanced civilization.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
